# Osmium
An attempt at a simple procedural programming language written in Zig. The language design was based on Jai, Odin, Go, Zig, Rust, C and OCaml in no particular order.

## Current Goal
get to a turing complete stage capable of printing hello, world!
- [x] lexer
- [x] parser
- [x] ir gen 
- [x] interpreter  
- [ ] native compiler
- [ ] type checking (may introduce another ast / ir)

## Afterwords
- [ ] File includes
- [ ] Generics or similair concepts
- [ ] Heap allocation
- [ ] FFI (possibly for a print function)
- [ ] namespacing ?
